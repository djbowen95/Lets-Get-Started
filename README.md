I will update this header section with a description of the project shortly. This is an example of what it will look like:
<p><strong>Quick and READ ME!</strong> is an easy-to-use, command-line interface that helps a user to quickly create a professional README markdown file. Created in <em>Node.js</em> with the <em>Inquirer npm package</em>, it can be run on a local machine from the command line. It will invite a user to answer a series of question prompts about their current project, and generate a simple README file based on their input. The user is then free to copy across to their own project's repository. </p>

## Project History
This project was build for the University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Web Development Coding Bootcamp. 
## Using the Work Day Scheduler
I will make GIFs and/or a short video demonstrating the project in action once it is complete.

## Key Features
This is a work in progress, but it should demonstrate at least one example of the following:
 - jQuery
 - Click events
 - Form handling
 - DOM traversal
 - Bootstrap
 - Google fonts
 - jQuery UI
 - Moment.js
## Version History
### Working towards 1.0.0 BootCamp Project
This project was something I built early into the course, and I ran out of time / wasn't happy with what I built. I am working this week (starting 06/02/2023) on completing the project so it fully functions and matches the Bootcamp brief. 
## Contribution
This is a small portfolio project and while I have a few more ideas for its development, I am not actively seeking collaborative contribution. I am always open to hearing ideas! If there's a feature you'd like to see, or you'd like to help build, I'd love to hear your idea. Please open an issue and outline it! I'll be sure to get back to you as soon as I can.
