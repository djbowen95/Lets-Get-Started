Simple work day scheduling application, that uses the Moment.js library to live track your day. Built in HTML and JavaScript, with Bootstrap styling and jQuery DOM Manipulation. This is a project that I built for the University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Coding Bootcamp, which I am revisiting as it was one of the projects I feel is weaker/needs more work.

## Project History
This project was build for the University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Web Development Coding Bootcamp. 
## How to Use
I will make GIFs and/or a short video demonstrating the project in action once it is complete.

## Key Features
This is a work in progress, but it should demonstrate at least one example of the following:
 - jQuery
 - Click events
 - Form handling
 - DOM traversal
 - Bootstrap
 - Google fonts
 - jQuery UI
 - Moment.js
## Version History
### Working towards 1.0.0 BootCamp Project
This project was something I built early into the course, and I ran out of time / wasn't happy with what I built. I am working this week (starting 06/02/2023) on completing the project so it fully functions and matches the Bootcamp brief. 
## Contribution
This is a small portfolio project and while I have a few more ideas for its development, I am not actively seeking collaborative contribution. I am always open to hearing ideas! If there's a feature you'd like to see, or you'd like to help build, I'd love to hear your idea. Please open an issue and outline it! I'll be sure to get back to you as soon as I can.
