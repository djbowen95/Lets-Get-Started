# Calendar
## Refactor Project: Outline
I am updating this application - which I built for my course - into something geniunely useful for me. I want to succinctly explain why I'd find a calendar application like this - no live updating, only tracking the day, useful.  

I want a simple app: it just highlights the current day and the days you have plans - three colours (today - I have plans, today - I don't, future days with plans). 

I need to be able to - view a day's plans - they appear in a list (mobile: separate page; desktop, right hand side - is this possible in handlebars?). Heading + note style. Possibly need to look at the note taker app for how to structure this.  

Could build this in Handlebars with MongoDB (if they work together) rather than React. Its a very simple app so not sure React would really make a difference!  

I can: add a plan/event (+ symbol, event title, note). 

Finally: I think it would be really cute to have a selection of themes. Maybe just 5 or 6 options - two main colours w/ several gradients. TRY: designing in black and white - then move to grey.

EXTRA: I would really like to use jQuery for this - just so I can say I've used it. jQuery UI possibly too - had a look at this and it did seem fun!

## HANDLEBARS
- I think this will work in Handlebars - I can essentially just have a 'flip' card when it is mobile that displays half the page or the other half.
